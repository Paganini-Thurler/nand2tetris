Conventions

In order to make the gates construction easier to understand, we will use the following conventions:
-If the inputs are few, letters will be used;
-Output from component gates will have the gate's name plus the input (andAB,notA,OrAB);
-if a gate is made of many coponents that are the same the output will have the gate's name plus a number (And1,And2);
